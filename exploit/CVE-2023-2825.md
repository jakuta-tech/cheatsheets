### Requirements
```
GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE) before: 16.0.1
The project needs to be nested in at least 5 groups.

File attachments are stored in the default Gitlab installation under the following path:
/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/uploads/@hashed/<a>/<b>/<secret>/<secret>/<file>
If you want to reach the filesystem root, you must go back 10 directories and therefore you need 11 groups.

Unauthenticated users can only exploit this vulnerability on public repositories matching the nested group requirements.
Authentication is required to access the repository itself.
```

### Run
```
Adjust the values in poc.py:

ENDPOINT
USERNAME
PASSWORD

python3 poc.py
```
